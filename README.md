# PinguFuzzBench - A Benchmark for Cryptographic Network Protocol Fuzzing

> [!NOTE] 
> **PINGU** is the abbreviation of cryptogra**P**hic network**ING** comm**U**nication protocols :)

PinguFuzzBench is a benchmark for the fuzzing of cryptographic network protocols. It is a specialized version of ProFuzzbench, which has removed some of the plaintext transmission network protocols from ProFuzzbench and added multiple encrypted network protocols (including TLS, SSH, QUIC, DTLS).

> [!NOTE]
> dcmtk, live555 and mosquitto are not cryptographic network protocols, but are included here in the benchmark for the purpose of testing the workness of the fuzzer, and serve as the baseline for cross-fuzzers comparison.

# Fuzzers

ProFuzzBench provides automation scripts for fuzzing the targets with three fuzzers: [AFLnwe](https://github.com/aflnet/aflnwe) (a network-enabled version of AFL, which sends inputs over a TCP/IP sockets instead of files), [AFLNet](https://github.com/aflnet/aflnet) (a fuzzer tailored for stateful network servers), and [StateAFL](https://github.com/stateafl/stateafl) (another fuzzer for stateful network servers).

In the following tutorial, you can find instructions to run AFLnwe and AFLnet (the first two fuzzers supported by ProFuzzBench). For more information about StateAFL, please check out [README-StateAFL.md](README-StateAFL.md).


# Tutorial - Fuzzing TLS/OpenSSL server with [AFLNet](https://github.com/aflnet/aflnet)
Follow the steps below to run and collect experimental results for TLS/OpenSSL. The similar steps should be followed to run experiments on other subjects. Each subject program comes with a README.md file showing subject-specific commands to run experiments.#

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure you have docker installed on your machine. If not, please refer to [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). The docker-engine that supports DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 would be better, but it is not required.
- **Storage**: Also make sure you have enough storage space for the built images and the fuzzing results. Usually, the pingu-env image is around 3.3GB and the fuzzing runtime image is around 4.3GB, depending on the target program.

For development purpose, you can build and launch a dedicated development environment for the fuzzing runtime. The container contains all the built fuzzing tool binaries. Note that the fuzzing target programs are not included. 

## Step-1. Build the base image

First change the working directory to the root directory of the repository.

```sh
./scripts/build-env.sh -f aflnet -- --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9870 --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9870 --network=host --build-arg GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx 
```

Arguments:
- ***-f*** : name of the fuzzer. Supports aflnet, stateafl, sgfuzz, ft, puffin, pingu.

The parameters specified after the **--** are the build arguments passed directly for the docker build command. You can specify sth like `--network=host --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=xxx`. Check the [Dockerfile-env](scripts/Dockerfile-env) to see the available build arguments.

### CI status of the base images

| Fuzzer   | Dockerfile                                             | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AFLNet   | [Dockerfile-aflnet](scripts/Dockerfile-env-aflnet)     | [![pingu-env-aflnet CI](https://github.com/fuzzing-peach/pingufuzzbench/actions/workflows/pingu-env-aflnet-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fuzzing-peach/pingufuzzbench/actions/workflows/pingu-env-aflnet-CI.yml)       |
| StateAFL | [Dockerfile-stateafl](scripts/Dockerfile-env-stateafl) | [![pingu-env-stateafl CI](https://github.com/fuzzing-peach/pingufuzzbench/actions/workflows/pingu-env-stateafl-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fuzzing-peach/pingufuzzbench/actions/workflows/pingu-env-stateafl-CI.yml) |
| SGFuzz   | [Dockerfile-sgfuzz](scripts/Dockerfile-env-sgfuzz)     | [![pingu-env-sgfuzz CI](https://github.com/fuzzing-peach/pingufuzzbench/actions/workflows/pingu-env-sgfuzz-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fuzzing-peach/pingufuzzbench/actions/workflows/pingu-env-sgfuzz-CI.yml)       |

## Step-1.5. (Optional) Launch the development environment

```sh
./scripts/dev.sh -f aflnet -- --network=host --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9870 --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9870
# It will run the container in the background. You need to run this script again.
# This time, arguments after the **--** can be ignored.
./scripts/dev.sh -f aflnet
```

## Step-2. Build the fuzzing runtime image

```sh
./scripts/build.sh -t TLS/OpenSSL -f ft -v 7b649c7 -- --network=host
```

The parameters specified after the **--** are the build arguments passed directly for the docker build command. You can specify sth like `--network=host --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=xxx`. Check the [Dockerfile](scripts/Dockerfile) to see the available build arguments.

Arguments:
- ***-t / --target*** : name of the target implementation (e.g., TLS/OpenSSL). The name should be referenced in the subjects directory.
- ***-f / --fuzzer*** : name of the fuzzer. Supports aflnet, stateafl, sgfuzz, ft, puffin, pingu.
- ***-v / --version*** : the version of the target implementation. Tag names and commit hashes are supported.

## Step-3. Fuzz

```sh
./scripts/run.sh -t TLS/OpenSSL -f ft -v 7b649c7 --times 1 --timeout 60 -o output
```

Required arguments:
- ***-t / --target*** : name of the target implementation (e.g., TLS/OpenSSL). The name should be referenced in the subjects directory.
- ***-f / --fuzzer*** : name of the fuzzer. Supports aflnet, stateafl, sgfuzz, ft, puffin, pingu.
- ***-v / --version*** : the version of the target implementation. Tag names and commit hashes are supported.
- ***--times*** : number of runs. The count of runs means the count of the docker containers.
- ***--timeout*** : timeout for each run, in seconds, like 86400 for 24 hours.
- ***-o / --output*** : output directory

Options:
- ***--cleanup*** : automatically delete the container after the fuzzing process.
- ***--detached*** : wait for the container to exit in the background.

## Step-4. Analyze the results

```sh
./scripts/evaluate.sh -t TLS/OpenSSL -f ft -v 7b649c7 -o output -c 2 -- --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9870 --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9870 --network=host $script_args
```
The parameters specified after the **--** are the build arguments passed directly for the docker build command. You can specify sth like `--network=host --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=xxx`. Check the [Dockerfile-eval](scripts/Dockerfile-eval) to see the available build arguments.

Required arguments:
- ***-t / --target*** : name of the target implementation (e.g., TLS/OpenSSL). The name should be referenced in the subjects directory.
- ***-f / --fuzzer*** : name of the fuzzer. Supports aflnet, stateafl, sgfuzz, ft, puffin, pingu.
- ***-v / --version*** : the version of the target implementation. Tag names and commit hashes are supported.
- ***-o / --output*** : the directory where the results are stored.
- ***-c / --count*** : the number of runs to be evaluated upon.


# Utility scripts


# Parallel builds

To speed-up the build of Docker images, you can pass the option "-j" to `make`, using the `MAKE_OPT` environment variable and the `--build-arg` option of `docker build`. Example:

```
export MAKE_OPT="-j4"
docker build . -t lightftp --build-arg MAKE_OPT
```
